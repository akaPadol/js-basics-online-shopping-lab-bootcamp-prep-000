/*1. The `addToCart()` function accepts one argument, the name of an item.
    + Use that passed-in string to create a new object representing the item. The object should consist of one key-value pair in which the key is the item's name and the value is a randomly-generated price: `{ itemName: itemPrice }`. As more items are added, the `cart` should start to look something like this: `[ { "bananas": 17 }, { "pancake batter": 5 }, { "eggs": 49 }]`.
    + The price of each item should be a randomly-generated integer between 1 and 100.
      * ***HINT***: Look into `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`.
    + If you're struggling to create a new object from the item name, remember that ES6 provides a nifty way to dynamically set the keys in an object literal. That is, it allows the use of variables as keys. If you're having trouble recalling the syntax, take a look back at the **Top Tip** in the [JavaScript Objects](https://learn.co/lessons/javascript-objects) lesson.
    + Upon the successful addition of a new item to the cart, the function should print `<itemName> has been added to your cart.` to the console and then `return` the updated `cart`.*/
